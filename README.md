# 8-Bit CPU Emulator (SAP-1) - MAPD-A Project

This project emulates an 8-bit CPU based on the SAP-1 model, simulating the CPU's clock-by-clock operation. The emulation replicates the detailed phases of the instruction cycle, including fetch and execute stages, for an in-depth understanding of CPU operations.

## Key Components
- **Registers:** Accumulator, B Register, Instruction Register (IR), Program Counter (PC)
- **Memory:** RAM, Memory Address Register (MAR)
- **ALU:** Arithmetic Logic Unit for addition and subtraction
- **Control Units:** Controller and Sequencer (CPU class)

The project provides a software-based simulation of hardware components in Python, allowing you to observe the inner workings of a basic 8-bit CPU.
